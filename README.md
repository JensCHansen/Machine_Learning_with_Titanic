# Machine_Learning_with_Titanic
Project made for the legendary Titanic ML competition
In this project I want to deal with the legendary Titanic Disaster Survival Challenge which has become one of the standard projects for newcomers to Data Science and Machine Learning. Having an own project to start with is a wonderful way of diving into Machine Learning and building a deeper knowledge and understanding.
